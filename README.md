Question 1: 
=================
Imagine you're designing an Ice Cream Shop system, where customers can order different types of ice creams. 
The shop offers a variety of flavors (like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), and 
they can choose to have their ice cream in different forms, such as a cone, cup, or sundae.
How would you design a system that allows customers to choose the type of ice cream without knowing the exact details of how each type is created?
 
Using the Factory Design Pattern in C# Design a solution that allows the ice cream parlor to create different types of ice cream like vanilla, chocolate, 
strawberry based on customer requests.

Question 2:  
=================

Suppose you have a performance-critical C# application that frequently creates and disposes of short-lived objects.
